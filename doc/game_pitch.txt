You are the nameless one. The one that stalks the night, making children everywhere
terrified to turn off the lights. You have been employed by a... shady company
who require your services to frighten the living daylights out of certain, targeted
children.

Before you go on your operation, the Intelligence division scouted ahead and found
out precisely what the target is scared of. But not all of their information is
accurate, some of it is contradictory, it's up to you, agent, to shift your 
lovecraftian monstrosity of a being into the single most petrifying thing in the 
world for this one, poor, child, for the good of the company.

Good luck, scarer.
